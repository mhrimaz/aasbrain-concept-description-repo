HoRi 2023.09.06 - Supported DBs will be MongoDB, and Redis.

HoRi 2023.09.06 - The first approach was to use Graphene, as it is the most popular tool out there. However, graphene-pydantic supports version 1. So I moved to Strawberry. It is also the suggested approach by FastAPI.

HoRi 2023.09.07 - As Neo4j Offers nice integration with GraphQL, Neo4j would be available as 3rd backend.

HoRi 2023.09.07 - Both Graphene and Strawberry are code-first approaches. As a result, two type should be created in parallel. For this reason, I move to Ariadne.
